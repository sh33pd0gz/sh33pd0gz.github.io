Hey! My name's Nik and I'm creating this site for a few reasons:

1. to explore topics of interest--software engineering, 
machine learning, big data, distributed systems, ai & llms, 
    maths & stats--in greater detail.

2. and share my investigations in an attempt engage with the 
broader software community and to grow my career technically
while working communication skills and presentation pageantry.

Some topics to expect...

* Stateful Streaming In Flink
* Big Data--Kafka (Schema Registry), Strimzi/Kubernetes Operator Pattern    
* Miscellaneous (Neo)Vim Demonstrations
* Domain-Driven Design Miniseries (inspired by Cosmic Python)
    - Python Microservices: Entities (Accounts, Locations, Devices), Enrollments (???)
    - Distributed Tracing (Grafana, Prometheus, Open Telemetry)
    - Data Streams--Some Event Happening on Device Population (Use Apache Flink)
